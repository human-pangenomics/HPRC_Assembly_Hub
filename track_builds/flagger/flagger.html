<h2>Description</h2>
<p> Flagger is a read-based pipeline that detects different types of misassemblies within a phased diploid assembly. The pipeline works by mapping the HiFi reads to the combined maternal and paternal assembly in a haplotype-aware manner and then identifying coverage inconsistencies within these read mappings that are likely due to assembly errors.

    <td>Err</td>

    <td>This block has low read coverage. If it is located in the middle of a contig it could be either a misjoin or a region that needs polishing.</td>

    <td>Duplicated</td>
    <td>Orange</td>
    <td>This block is potentially a false duplication of another block. It should mainly include low-MAPQ alignments with half of the expected coverage. Probably one of the copies has to be polished to fix this issue.</td>

    <td>Haploid</td>

    <td>This block is correctly assembled and has the expected read coverage.</td>

    <td>Purple</td>
    <td>Two or more highly similar haplotypes are collapsed into this block.</td>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p> Flagger is documented in its <a href="https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.


  Briefly, it has three steps:
<ul>
  <li>Calculate the read coverage of each assembly base</li>
  <li>Fit a mixture model to the coverage distributions</li>
  <li>Extract the blocks assigned to the model's 4 main components: erroneous, duplicated, haploid, and collapsed.</li>
</ul>
</p>
