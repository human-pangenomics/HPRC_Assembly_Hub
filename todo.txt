1. add color to repeat masker beds
	--Then I can make the rmskBed.as file closer to Mark's @ https://github.com/diekhans/T2T-CHM13-hub/blob/master/etc/rmskBed.as
	--Also check w/ Mark about what he is doing w/ the score field (which can be over 1000 which causes bedToBigBed to complain)

2. Update sedef to include more fields from bedpe files

3. Update DNA_BRNN
	--include 6 assemblies not in pangenome
	--make output (1/2) more easily recognizable

4. Update TRF
	--try to emulate hg38 behavior (where the display shows motif, not period size)

5. Change s3 locations (for pulling in files) to working (from submissions)
